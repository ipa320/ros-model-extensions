### Core component

- Generate code from the models
- This is relatively easy to be supported by add-in plugins. For eclipse we have just to create the command (how the generator will be called, I.e., right click on the model, a button from the toolbar...) and then connect the handler of the command to the code generator written in Xtend. The RosTooling contains already a couple of examples.
- This category can include M2M conversions

### Concept for extension

- Automatic from Model to model, source code, launch files....
- From design model, add a helper GUI and generate artifacts

### Available examples and tutorials

- Ros1 and Ros2 cpp code generators
- SeRoNet – ROS mixed ports
- Deployment artifacts generator
- Observers generators
- (ARAIG test framework generator?)
- Documentation generator
- ROS1-ROS2 bridges generator
